# first-project

This is my first attempt at a coding project. I will be creating a game of rock, paper, scissors. 

## language

I have started learning python, so that is what I will be using. I am still in the beginer stages of learning this language. 

### Why

I started this project becuase I feel that it will help me progress more quickly than just reading and practicing on a free bootcamp.

#### About me 

I am currently a sophomore at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 
I am a political Science major
I am learning to code on my own because of a new-found interest.
